# Help, Support, FAQ

See: [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/LGLTeam/Android-Hooking-Patching-Template/wiki/FAQ) where common questions are answered.

This project does not cover the basics how to mod games in general, you must have the skills already!

If you have installation or usage problems, try asking your questions on the forum sites, [Platinmods](https://platinmods.com/forums/modding-questions-discussions.11/), or [UnknownCheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/android/) or others.

For example, if you have an issue with Hooking and game crashes, you should go to the **support forums**. Here there are no teachers who can help you with such issues.

Issues are disabled permanently due to peoples who have no mind (mostly newbies) aren't even able to fill proper issue templates nor are they able to read the instructions. I get so many useless issues, even useless pull-requests.
